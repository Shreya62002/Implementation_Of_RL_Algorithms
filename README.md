Gym-minigrid Implementation
Training an agent using RL tabular methods, namely TD learning on gym-minigrid

gym-minigrid - https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid

The agent has been trained using 3 algoriths:

Sarsa0
Sarsa Lambda
Q-Learning
The agent was trained on 4 environments:

5x5 Empty room
6x6 Empty room
8x8 Empty room
Four Rooms
Resuts:
Graphs between episode and rewards and episode and steps were plotted.
